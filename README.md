 Unsplash API :

In this project, you'll be working with the Unsplash API to create an app where users can search for a category and see a list of images that fit that result.

API Access

The first thing you'll need to do is to sign up for an account. You can do that here, just click the "Register as a developer" button.

You'll need to specify your first and last name, email address and username/password combination. Once you join you should visit the Terms page and click the Continue button.

On the developer profile page, you don't need to specify a URL, and under the What are you going to build? section, you can just say, "School Project". You'll then be directed to your Applications Page, where you need to click the "New Application" button. Provide any name you'd like and just leave the Public Access box checked. Once complete, you'll be taken to a page that contains your Application ID.
